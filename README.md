# Web_Scrapping_Udemy
## ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my web-scrapping project
### In this repo, 
### -> I've uploaded all my code related to theory lectures and projects as well.
## ðŸŽ¯ The modules used in this project :-
### -> requests library : A easy python library to send HTTP requests to servers. Link : https://pypi.org/project/requests/
### -> Beautiful Soup : A easy , simple to learn library used to scrape simple websites, like blogging sites etc. with simple HTML code. Link : https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
### -> Selenium : Although selenium is a tool used to test web applications, automate browsers but is also used in web-scrapping due to it's ability to simulate human actions on browser and websites, like clicking on links, scrolling etc. Unlike bs4, it can websites wrapped with heavy JS , but as a consequence of it's ability , it is slower than bs4 as it works with heavy , complex JS codes.

### -> Scrapy : A python framework that not only provides a complete project structure but also allows scraping multiple websites parallely due to it's asynchronous nature. It can scrape a large amount of data quickly , faster than bs4, selenium. Link : https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/
